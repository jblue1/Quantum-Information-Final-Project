# Quantum-Information-Final-Project
Final project for a quantum information class at Davidson College

## Ising
The ising folder contains code to do a digitial quantum circuit simulation of a 1-D Ising model with two spins. 
The ```main.py``` script will produce a plot showing the analytic solution of the expectation value of
the spin along the z axis for each site as well as the results from the simulation. As the number of
Trotter steps is increased, the simulation approaches the true values.
